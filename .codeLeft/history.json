It would be better to define this as a constant or retrieve it from a configuration file:\n   ```go\n   const baseURL = \"http://localhost:2008\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Redundant Error Checks**: The error checks for `TestConstructor` and `SendRequest` are similar. Consider creating a helper function to reduce redundancy and improve readability:\n   ```go\n   func checkError(t *testing.T, err error, msg string) {\n       if err != nil {\n           t.Errorf(\"%s: %v\", msg, err)\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\nOverall, the code is functional but could benefit from improved error handling, configuration management, and reduced redundancy.\n```"

For example, in `SecurityComparator`:\n\n   ```go\n   if yourTest.Security == nil || defaultTest.Security == nil {\n       return false // Fail comparison if security is nil\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Code Duplication**: Each comparator has similar logic for checking properties. This could be refactored into a shared function to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability. \n\n3. **Lack of Documentation**: The code lacks comments explaining the purpose of each comparator and the overall logic in `TestComparison`.

It would be beneficial to log the error or provide more context about the failure. For example, consider enhancing the error message returned to include the URL or request details.\n\n   ```go\n   if err != nil {\n       return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to send request to %s: %w\", c.BaseURL, err)\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Dependency Injection**: The `NewDefaultClient` function tightly couples the `HttpClient` and `RequestSender` implementations. Allowing these to be injected as parameters would improve testability and flexibility.\n\n   ```go\n   func NewDefaultClient(password, url string, httpClient HttpClient, requestSender RequestSender) *Client {\n       return &Client{\n           Password:          password,\n           BaseURL:           url,\n           HttpClient:        httpClient,\n           RequestSender:     requestSender,\n           ResponseProcessor: NewResponseProcessor(),\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Struct Field Visibility**: The `Password` field in the `Client` struct is exported, which may pose a security risk. Consider making it unexported and providing a method to access it securely if needed.\n\n   ```go\n   type Client struct {\n       password          string // unexported\n       ...\n   }\n   ```\n\nOverall, the code is structured well, but addressing these concerns will enhance maintainability and security.\n```"

This can lead to silent failures. Consider implementing error handling to notify users of invalid inputs.\n\n   ```go\n   if protoChoices == nil {\n       log.Error(\"protoChoices is nil\")\n       return nil\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Type Conversion**: The conversion from `int` to `int32` in `ConvertModelToProtoChoices` could lead to data loss if the `Number` exceeds the `int32` range. Ensure that the value is within the acceptable range before conversion.\n\n   ```go\n   if modelChoices.Number > math.MaxInt32 {\n       log.Error(\"Number exceeds int32 limit\")\n       return nil\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Code Duplication**: Both functions share similar structures. Consider creating a helper function to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.\n\n   ```go\n   func convertChoices(input interface{}) *jsonSchema.Choices {\n       // common conversion logic\n   }\n   ```\n\nOverall, while the code is functional, addressing these concerns will enhance robustness and maintainability.\n```"

For example, the error returned when `extractFileContents` fails does not provide enough context. Consider enhancing error messages to include the file path for better debugging.\n\n   ```go\n   return nil, \"\", fmt.Errorf(\"Error processing code path '%s': %s\", filePath, err.Error())\n   ```\n\n2. **Language Extraction Logic**: The logic for extracting languages could be improved. Currently, it only checks for \"Unknown\" but does not handle cases where the language might be unsupported or invalid. Implementing a more robust validation would enhance reliability.\n\n   ```go\n   if language == \"Unknown\" {\n       // Log or handle unsupported language case\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Code Duplication**: The construction of system prompts is repetitive. Consider creating a helper function to generate these prompts to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.\n\n   ```go\n   func createSystemPrompt(language, context string) string {\n       return fmt.Sprintf(\"You are reviewing the code written in %s, and you should provide detailed feedback on its structure, readability, and maintainability.\", language)\n   }\n   ```\n\nOverall, while the code is functional, addressing these concerns would enhance its robustness and maintainability.\n```"
