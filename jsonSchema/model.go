		How this works is that it needs to be in a of definitions which match with the properties field. From the properties fields the choice of those keys will be selected
		the information of what the overall object, the properties being selected along with the instruction and their type and the types that they contain if the object goes down further.
		the prompt will also be pass in so that the agent can make the best decesion possible

		Once the choices have been selected the choices that haven't been selected will be deleted from the remaining keys avialible in both the ordered and unordered keys.
